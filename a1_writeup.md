# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
My initial experience with Python was smooth but also slightly confusing at times. Coming from an AP Computer Science A background, I was used to Java's syntax. Especially the need for semicolons, type declarations, and braces. Python felt more readable, which made writing code easier, but I had to get used to things like indentation-based blocks and not declaring variable types explicitly.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
When I ran into an error in Problem 2 (FizzBuzz), I asked:
“Why is this wrong?”
AI was able to analyze my code, point out that I was trying to iterate over an integer, and explain how to fix it using range().
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
Avoiding common Python mistakes like mixing up strings and integers or using methods like incorrectly.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
Collaborating with AI is most effective when I ask specific questions ("Why is this loop not working?") gives better answers than vague ones.
